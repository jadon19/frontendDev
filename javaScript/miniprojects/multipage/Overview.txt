1. JavaScript Function

A function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task.
Functions help in reducing repetition, improving readability, and organizing logic.
A function can accept inputs (parameters) and may return a result.
Functions are executed only when they are called.

2. DOM (Document Object Model)

The DOM is a programming interface created by the browser from HTML.
It represents the webpage as a tree structure that JavaScript can access and modify.
Using the DOM, JavaScript can read, change, add, or remove HTML elements dynamically.
The document object represents the entire webpage.

3. Selecting Elements from the DOM

JavaScript provides multiple ways to access HTML elements.

getElementById()

Selects a single element using its id

Id must be unique

Faster and commonly used

Returns one element or null

querySelector()

Selects the first element matching a CSS selector

Uses CSS syntax like #id, .class, tag

More flexible than getElementById

querySelectorAll()

Selects all elements matching a CSS selector

Returns a NodeList (collection of elements)

Used when working with multiple similar elements

Difference Summary

getElementById → single element, id only

querySelector → first match, CSS-based

querySelectorAll → multiple matches, CSS-based

4. Events and Event Listeners

An event is an action performed by the user or browser, such as click, keypress, or scroll.
JavaScript listens for events using addEventListener().
When the specified event occurs, the associated function is executed.
Using event listeners is preferred over inline event handlers because it keeps HTML and JavaScript separate.

5. Data Attributes (data-*)

Data attributes are custom HTML attributes used to store extra information.
They do not affect page behavior by themselves.
JavaScript can read them using getAttribute().
They are commonly used to link UI elements with logic.

6. Synchronous vs Asynchronous Execution

Synchronous Execution

Tasks run one after another

Next task waits until the previous task finishes

Can block the browser and make the page unresponsive

Asynchronous Execution

Long tasks run in the background

JavaScript continues execution

Browser remains responsive

JavaScript uses asynchronous execution for network requests and timers.

7. fetch()

fetch() is used to request resources such as HTML files or APIs.
It is asynchronous and does not return the result immediately.
Instead, it returns a Promise representing a future value.

8. Promise

A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
It has three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected.
Promises allow JavaScript to handle delayed operations without blocking execution.

9. then()

.then() is used to handle the successful completion of a Promise.
It runs after the Promise is fulfilled.
Multiple .then() calls can be chained to perform step-by-step processing.

10. response.text()

When fetch() completes, it returns a Response object.
response.text() converts the response into readable text, such as HTML content.
This step is required before displaying fetched content.

11. innerHTML

innerHTML represents all the HTML inside an element.
Setting innerHTML replaces existing content with new content.
It is commonly used to dynamically update page sections.

12. Error Handling using catch()

.catch() handles errors in asynchronous code.
It executes when a Promise is rejected.
Proper error handling prevents blank screens and improves user experience.

13. Single Page Application Behavior

When only part of a webpage changes without reloading the entire page, it is called SPA behavior.
This is achieved by dynamically replacing content using JavaScript.
Navigation feels faster and smoother to users.
